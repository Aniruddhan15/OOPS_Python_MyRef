🗓️ Weekly Roadmap to Master Python OOP
✅ Week 1: OOP Basics & Class Foundations
🧠 Concepts:
What is OOP? Why OOP?

Differences between procedural and OOP styles.

class, object, self, __init__ constructor

Instance variables and methods

🛠️ Practice:
Create a Car class with properties like brand, model, year

Add methods like start(), stop()

Create multiple objects of the class

🔍 Checkpoint Questions:
What is the role of self?

What happens when you instantiate a class?

🔗 Resources:
Python Docs – Classes

Real Python – OOP in Python

✅ Week 2: Class & Static Methods, Encapsulation
🧠 Concepts:
Class variables vs. instance variables

@classmethod and @staticmethod

Private and protected variables

Getter, setter (@property, @<attr>.setter)

Encapsulation principle

🛠️ Practice:
Create a BankAccount class

Implement deposit, withdraw methods

Add class variable to keep count of accounts

Use @property to return balance securely

🔍 Checkpoint Questions:
When to use @classmethod vs @staticmethod?

How does encapsulation protect data?

✅ Week 3: Inheritance, Polymorphism, Magic Methods
🧠 Concepts:
Inheritance: Single, Multilevel, Multiple

super() keyword

Method Overriding (Polymorphism)

Operator Overloading with Magic Methods (__add__, __eq__, etc.)

🛠️ Practice:
Create a base class Employee and subclasses Manager, Developer

Implement common and specialized behavior

Add __str__, __repr__, __eq__ to your classes

🔍 Checkpoint Questions:
How does super() work?

What are magic/dunder methods?

✅ Week 4: Abstraction, Composition, Real-world OOP
🧠 Concepts:
Abstract Base Classes (abc module), @abstractmethod

Composition vs. Inheritance

OOP Design Principles: SOLID (overview)

DRY principle

🛠️ Practice:
Use ABC to define interfaces like Shape (Circle, Rectangle)

Build a Computer class composed of CPU, RAM, Disk components

🔍 Checkpoint Questions:
What’s the difference between composition and inheritance?

Why is abstraction useful?
